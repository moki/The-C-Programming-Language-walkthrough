## 5.7 Multi-dimensional Arrays
C provides rectangular multi-dimensional arrays, although in practice they are much less used than arrays of pointers.

### Key points:

1. TODO

### Examples:

#### Stripped-down version of UNIX TODO

  Refer to **TODO.c** for implementation.

  ##### Compile and run the code:

  ```
  $ gcc -o TODO TODO.c

  $ ./TODO
  ```

### Exercises:

#### Exercise 5-7
  Rewrite readlines to store lines in an array supplied by main, rather than calling alloc to maintain stoorage.
  
  Refer to the code in **TODO.c**.

##### Compile and run the code:

```
$ gcc -o TODO TODO.c

$ ./TODO
```
