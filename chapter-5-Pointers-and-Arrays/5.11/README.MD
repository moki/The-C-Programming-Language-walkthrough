## 5.11 Pointers To Functions

### Key points:

1. In C function itself is not a variable, but it is possible to define pointers to functions, which can be assigned, placed in arrays, passed to functions, returned by functions, and so on.

### Examples:

#### Echo

  Refer to **sort.c** for implementation.

  ##### Compile and run the code:

  ```
  $ gcc -o sort sort.c

  $ ./sort
  ```

### Exercises:

#### Exercise 5-10 - 5-13
  TODO.
  
  Refer to the code in **TODO.c**.

##### Compile and run the code:

```
$ gcc -o TODO TODO.c

$ ./TODO
```
