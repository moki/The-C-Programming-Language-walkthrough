## 3.7 Break and Continue
It is sometimes **convinient** to be able to exit from a loop **other than** by **testing** at the **top** or the **bottom**.

### Key points:

1. **break** statement **provides** early **exit** from for, while, and do, just as from switch.

2. **continue** statement is **realted** to **break**, but less often used. It causes the next iteration of the enclosing **for, while, do** loop to **begin**.

    In the **while and do** loop control passed to the **test** part.

    In the **for** control passes to **increment** step.

    **continue** statement **applies only to loops not to switch**
