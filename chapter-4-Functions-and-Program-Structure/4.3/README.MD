## 4.3 External Variables
A c program consists of a set of external objects, which are either variables or function.

### Key points:

1. **External** variables **defined** outside of any function.

2. **Functions** themselves are always **external**.

3. **External** variables are **globally accessible**

### Examples:

#### Calculator

  Refer to the code in **calculator.c**.

  ##### Compile and run the code:

  ```
  $ gcc -o calculator calculator.c

  $ ./calculator
  ```
