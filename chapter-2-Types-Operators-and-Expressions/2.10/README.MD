## 2.10 Assignment Operators and Expressions

### Key points:

1. **Assignment shorthand** - += assignment operator.

    In the expression like

    ```
    i = i + 1;
    ```

    in which the variable on the left hand side of = is repeated immediatly on the right, can be written in the compressed form:

    ```
    i += 1;
    ```

    **Most binary operators** have corresponding **op**=, where **op** is one of:

    #### +, -, *, /, %, <<, >>, &, ^, |
