# Chapter 2 - Types, Operators, and Expressions
Variables and constants are the basic data objects manipulated in a program.

**Delcarations** - list the variables to be used, and state what type they have and perhaps what their initial values are.

**Operators** - specify what is to be done to them.

**Expressions** - combine variables and constants to produce new values.

**Type** of an object determines the set of values it can have and what operations can be performed on it.

These building blocks and the topics of this chapter.
