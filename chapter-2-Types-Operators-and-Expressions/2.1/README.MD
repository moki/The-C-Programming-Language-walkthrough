## 2.1 Variable Names

### Key points:

1. There are some restrictions on the names of variables and symbolic constants.
    
2. Names made up of letters and digits.

3. First character must be a letter, the **underscore** _ counts as letter.

4. **Traditional C practice** is to use **lower case** for **variable names**, and **all upper case** for **symbolic constants**.

5. Keywords like **if, else, int, float, etc., are reserved** you **can't use them** as variables names.

6. It's wise to choose variable names that are related to the purpose of the variable, and that are unlikely to get mixed up typographically.
